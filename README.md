# Data Science Portfolio

This is Portfolio file of Pakcheera Choppradit. It contain all competitions, self learning and University project in Data Science field.  '

## Contents


- ### Python

	- [Data mining](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20mining):

         This is my University project. It focus on how to do data mining process including cleaning data, preprocessing data, sloving imbalance dataset, validation and training data. You can see more information in full report at here. ([Report](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20mining/Report_Chopprdit_20303349.pdf))
	 
	 - [M5 Forecasting](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/M5%20Forecasting):

         This is Kaggle competition on time series dataset. I use LightGBM model in competition with custom validation. You can see more information about competition and dataset at here. ([Information](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy))
	 
	 - [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Toxic%20Comment%20Classification%20Challenge):

         This is Kaggle competition on NLP field. I use bagging logistic regression (processing by TF-IDF)
and bidirectional LSTM method to the competition. You can see more information about competition and dataset at here. ([Information](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge))

	- [TMLCC](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TMLCC):

         This is Thailand Machine Learning for Chemistry Competition. I use CNN-NN model from two input data. The frist one from structure data and another from SMILES form that transform to 2 dimentions data. I won the popular vote and ranked 26
from 250 teams of accuracy score. 
	
	
	
- ### R

	- [Compare NN and ARIMA](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Compare%20NN%20and%20ARIMA):

         This is my senior project. It is focus on ARIMA processs and comparing it with NN model. You can see more information in full report at here. ([Report](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Compare%20NN%20and%20ARIMA/Report.pdf))
	- [Compare-Machine-learning-deteced-spam-email-main](https://github.com/pakcheera/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Compare-Machine-learning-deteced-spam-email-main):
	 
         This is my University project. It use RDB to compare machine learning on spam email.
